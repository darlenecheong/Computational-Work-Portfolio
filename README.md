## Work Samples  
**Below are the repositories for 8 of my computational work samples:**
<br><br>
### Web Development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):
#### [ðŸ”— Portfolio Website](https://github.com/darlenecheong/Personal-Website)
- *A personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my background and projects.*
---

### Data/Statistical Analyses and Models (R):
#### [ðŸ”— SIR Model Simulation](https://github.com/darlenecheong/Simulating-Disease-Dynamics)
- *This project uses a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to simulate and analyze the spread of infectious diseases, exploring the impact of infection and recovery rates on disease dynamics over time.*
#### [ðŸ”— Exploratory Data Analysis on PPE Usage and Weather](https://github.com/darlenecheong/PPE-Usage-Weather-Analysis) 
- *An exploratory data analysis looking at the relationship between weather conditions and personal protective equipment (PPE) usage, aiming to understand how temperature, humidity, and weather types can influence PPE compliance.*
- #### [ðŸ”— Bacterial Sporulation T-Test Analysis](https://github.com/darlenecheong/Sporulation-T-Test) 
- *An R script for performing two-sample t-tests to compare sporulation efficiency between wild-type and mutant Bacillus subtilis strains.*
---

### Python Projects:
#### [ðŸ”— Blackjack Simulator](https://github.com/darlenecheong/Blackjack-Simulator) 
- *A Python implementation of the classic Blackjack card game, featuring functionality for dealing cards, calculating hand values, and determining the winner between the player and the dealer.*

#### [ðŸ”— Username and Password Validator](https://github.com/darlenecheong/Username-Password-Validator)
- *This Python script validates usernames and passwords based on specific criteria (such as length, character types, and restrictions) and provides a function to generate secure passwords that meet all requirements.*
---

### ArcGIS Project:
#### [ðŸ”— Transit Risk Zones during COVID-19 in NYC](https://github.com/darlenecheong/NYC-COVID19-Transit-RiskZones)
- *An ArcGIS map visualizing transportation methods used by patients leaving medical facilities in NYC during the COVID-19 PAUSE order, highlighting potential risk zones based on transit ridership and mobility patterns.*
---

### Arduino (C++) Project:
#### [ðŸ”— Motion Activated Feeder](https://github.com/darlenecheong/Motion-Activated-Feeder)
- *C++ code for an Arduino Uno board, functioning to control an automated pellet feeder system, using a PIR sensor to trigger pellet release upon motion detection.*
