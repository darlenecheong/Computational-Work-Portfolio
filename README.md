A Python implementation of the classic Blackjack card game, featuring functionality for dealing cards, calculating hand values, and determining the winner between the player and the dealer.
<br><br>

#### [🔗 Username and Password Validator](https://github.com/darlenecheong/Username-Password-Validator)
This Python script validates usernames and passwords based on specific criteria (such as length, character types, and restrictions) and provides a function to generate secure passwords that meet all requirements.
<br><br>

#### [🔗 Text Synonym Replacer](https://github.com/darlenecheong/Text-Synonym-Replacer)
This Python script validates usernames and passwords based on specific criteria (such as length, character types, and restrictions) and provides a function to generate secure passwords that meet all requirements.
<br><br>

### ArcGIS:
#### [🔗 Transit Risk Zones during COVID-19 in NYC](https://github.com/darlenecheong/NYC-COVID19-Transit-RiskZones)
An ArcGIS map visualizing transportation methods used by patients leaving medical facilities in NYC during the COVID-19 PAUSE order, highlighting potential risk zones based on transit ridership and mobility patterns.
<br><br>

### Arduino (C++):
#### [🔗 Motion Activated Feeder](https://github.com/darlenecheong/Motion-Activated-Feeder)
C++ code for an Arduino Uno board, functioning to control an automated pellet feeder system, using a PIR sensor to trigger pellet release upon motion detection.
